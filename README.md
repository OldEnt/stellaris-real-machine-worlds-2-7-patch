This patch updates a single file to make [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1144654097]Real Machine Worlds[/url] work in Stellaris 2.7+.

\common\planet_classes\rmw_planet_classes.txt

This patch is set as  a dependant on Real Machine Worlds so load order should not matter. You can still put it below RMW in the load order if you want to.

- Added district_set = machine_world line to support 2.7 Stellaris district changes.
- Replaced obsolete modifier for Machine World with proper ones ( planet_jobs_produces_mult = 0.10 pop_housing_usage_mult = -0.10 		pop_environment_tolerance = 0.0 )
- removed obsolete line: allowed_archetypes = { MACHINE ROBOT }

This mod will be deleted from the Steam Workshop when the core mod gets an update.
